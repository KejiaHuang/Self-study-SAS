# Self-study-SAS

I almost never trid to use SAS in programming even after pass SAS advanced exam. It is definetly not good.

So I do the every exercises in the SAS book : Learn from example. 

I gave up spring break and spent 8 hours per day for three weeks in library by myself. 

There is always a clock remind me to finish this 1000 pages book faster, as other tasks too...

This is what I can do.

It is not smart but it is ture.
