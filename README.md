# Self-study-SAS

I almost never trid to use SAS in programming even after pass SAS advanced exam. It is definetly not good.

So I do the every exercises in the SAS book : Learn from example. 

I gave up spring break and spent 8 hours per day for three weeks in library by myself. 

From 3/7/2017 to 3/29/2017
